## API
 I'm using the api of the newsapi. Funny enough that is the actual name of the api. 
 [Can be found here](https://newsapi.org)


## What have I been doing untill  now
I came across some problems with the API I initially wanted to use. Important part's are no longer usable without the aproval of the author first. And Oauth.. You don't want to come across this during this assignment.
I've been experimenting with classes and inheriting in JS. Came up with a solution that might be redundant, but I think it is a good exercise. 

## TODO

		-Routing
		-Templating
		-Dividing the code in modules
